#This work includes all the necessary files to perform statistical analysis of data from Community-Level Physiological Profiles (i.e. Biolog Ecoplates)
#The work includes several files, a file with the raw data used as an example, a file with the packages that must be installed, a file with the necessary functions and a file with the R-script to perform the complete analysis.
#The analysis includes data transformation into compositional data by means of isometric log-ratio transformation, statistical analyses with multivariate MANOVA analysis and graphical representation through canonical variates plot.
#Before running the R-script, please (1) follow data organization suggested in the "raw_data" file; (2) run the script "install_packages";
#(3) run the script "functions"; (4) run the R-script
#if you have any problem with the R-script please do not hesitate to ask me (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nuria_Perujo)
